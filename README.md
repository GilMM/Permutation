# Permutation

A permutation of a character string is a string obtained by some kind of mixing of the order of characters in the original string.
The program accepts two arguments on the command line: name of an input file, and a string of characters. And the program scans the contents of the file, and prints to the standard output all the permutations of the string that will be found in the file.
